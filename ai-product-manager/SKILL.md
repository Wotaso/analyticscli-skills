# AI Product Manager

## Use This Skill When

- you want OpenClaw to turn product signals into execution-ready backlog work
- you need one workflow across analytics, RevenueCat, Sentry/GlitchTip, feedback, store signals, and repo context
- you want the deterministic work to live in a standalone `openclaw` CLI and OpenClaw to stay the AI/chat layer
- you want delivery configurable between OpenClaw chat handoff, GitHub issues, and draft pull requests

## Preferred Runtime

Prefer the standalone `openclaw` CLI as the runtime surface.

- Setup path: `openclaw setup --config openclaw.config.json`
- Primary path: `openclaw start --config openclaw.config.json`
- Local monorepo path: `pnpm --filter @analyticscli/openclaw-cli dev start --repo-root <repo-root>`
- Legacy copied-runtime scripts under `scripts/openclaw-growth-*.mjs` remain fallback-only for older OpenClaw workspaces

The CLI is intentionally non-AI. OpenClaw should stay the only conversational and implementation layer.
Use the CLI to gather signals, generate proposals, schedule checks, and send deliveries.
If the user later asks OpenClaw to implement a proposal, OpenClaw should inspect the generated drafts and then use OpenClaw itself to do the work.

## Customization Boundary

Treat this installed skill as vendor-managed and replaceable.
OpenClaw should almost never edit this skill in-place for user- or project-specific customization, because future ClawHub updates may overwrite local changes.
When the user wants custom behavior, create a separate companion skill or project-local customization skill instead, for example `openclaw-growth-custom`, and have that skill reference or layer on top of this one.
Only modify this skill directly when the change is intended as an upstream reusable fix for the canonical skill repository.

## Setup DX Rules

Setup should feel guided for a developer, not like a silent preflight dump.

- Prefer auto-detection and direct fixes over asking the user to run generic commands.
- In chat, explain only what the user needs for the next step. Put provider details, scopes, and secret prompts in the wizard unless the user asks.
- Ask for the minimum missing value only; do not request issue/PR permissions unless artifact creation is enabled.
- For blockers, return one short next action first. Add detailed status, permissions, or URLs only when the user asks or the wizard needs that value.
- After each setup phase, summarize only the result and the next concrete action.
- Keep secrets out of prompts, repo files, logs, and command arguments; prefer OpenClaw secret storage or environment injection.
- Never ask the user to paste API keys, GitHub tokens, or App Store Connect `.p8` private-key contents into Discord, OpenClaw chat, GitHub issues, PRs, or any shared transcript. Discord/chat is not an appropriate secret transport.
- For secrets, give a secure host-terminal path: set env vars in the runtime shell, an OpenClaw secret store, a password manager injection flow, or a locked-down env file such as `~/.config/openclaw-growth/secrets.env` with `chmod 600`. For `.p8`, prefer writing the file on the host with `umask 077`, store only its path as `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, and never echo the private key back.
- When SDK instrumentation is missing or weak, guide the developer through the `analyticscli-ts-sdk` setup path so analytics events become useful for later growth analysis.
- If AnalyticsCLI has no default project and multiple projects are visible, do not report that as a hard error. List the available projects, ask the user which one to use, persist the choice with `openclaw start --config openclaw.config.json --project <project_id>` or `analyticscli projects select <project_id>`, and then retry the setup/run.

During setup chat, keep the first answer short. OpenClaw should not dump provider docs, permissions, status history, or troubleshooting unless the user asks for details.

Hard override for AI Growth Engineer connector questions:

If the user says any of these or close variants, apply this override before any generic OpenClaw, AnalyticsCLI, MCP, messaging-channel, or env-var connector knowledge:

- "AI Growth Engineer connectors"
- "analyticscli connectors"
- "AI Product Manager connectors"
- "I want to setup connectors" in the context of this skill
- "which connectors can I set up" in the context of this skill
- "how do I set them up" after asking about this skill's connectors

Answer only with this shape:

```text
AI Growth Engineer connectors:
- GitHub code access
- RevenueCat monetization data
- App Store Connect CLI

Run the wizard on the VPS:
```

```bash
cd /home/lo/.openclaw/workspace && \
  bash skills/ai-product-manager/scripts/bootstrap-openclaw-workspace.sh && \
  node scripts/openclaw-growth-wizard.mjs --connectors
```

Then add only: "Select the connectors in the wizard. Secrets stay in the terminal."

Do not list Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Matrix, OpenAI service connectors, MCP servers, browser connectors, Sentry, feedback endpoints, raw environment variables, token scopes, verification commands, or provider URLs in the initial answer. Those details belong inside the wizard or in a direct follow-up answer.


If the user asks a broad question such as "how do I setup everything", answer with only:

```text
Available connectors:
- GitHub code access
- RevenueCat monetization data
- App Store Connect CLI

Run the wizard from the OpenClaw workspace:
```

```bash
cd /home/lo/.openclaw/workspace && \
  bash skills/ai-product-manager/scripts/bootstrap-openclaw-workspace.sh && \
  node scripts/openclaw-growth-wizard.mjs --connectors
```

Then add one sentence: "The wizard will ask for the selected connectors and any secrets in the local terminal only."

If the user asks which connectors exist, list only the connector names and one short purpose each. Do not include setup URLs, permissions, token scopes, status history, or validation output in that initial answer.

If the user already names specific connectors, still prefer the checkbox wizard unless they explicitly ask for a non-interactive command. For explicit connector setup, use one copy-paste command with `cd` first:

```bash
cd /home/lo/.openclaw/workspace && \
  bash skills/ai-product-manager/scripts/bootstrap-openclaw-workspace.sh && \
  node scripts/openclaw-growth-wizard.mjs --connectors github,revenuecat,asc
```

Use only the connectors the user accepted. The wizard owns provider-specific instructions, local-terminal secret prompts, helper setup, and smoke tests. Chat should only summarize results after the wizard finishes or when the user asks.
For GitHub, the wizard must try to install `gh` automatically into `~/.local/bin` when it is missing. Do not tell the user to install GitHub CLI manually unless that automatic user-local install fails.

Do not ask for `ASC_APP_ID` during initial setup. After ASC auth works, list/infer apps. If the target is ambiguous, ask for the app name first; only ask for a numeric app id if app-name resolution fails.

Connection setup requests are not satisfied by a successful product-manager run. If the user asks to set up `asc`, App Store Connect, RevenueCat, GitHub, or codebase access, point them to the wizard command above and keep any extra explanation out of chat unless requested.

Safe secret handoff rules:

- Do not ask the user to send secrets through Discord/OpenClaw chat. It is not safe enough for API keys, GitHub tokens, or `.p8` private keys because messages can be retained, logged, indexed, screenshotted, or visible to other bots/users.
- Ask the user to set secrets directly on the host where OpenClaw runs, then reply only with "done" or the non-sensitive file path/variable name.
- Good terminal pattern for env secrets:
  ```bash
  install -d -m 700 ~/.config/openclaw-growth
  umask 077
  $EDITOR ~/.config/openclaw-growth/secrets.env
  # add lines like:
  # REVENUECAT_API_KEY=...
  # ASC_KEY_ID=...
  # ASC_ISSUER_ID=...
  # ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/home/lo/.config/openclaw-growth/AuthKey_XXXX.p8
  chmod 600 ~/.config/openclaw-growth/secrets.env
  ```
- Good `.p8` pattern: save the downloaded App Store Connect private key directly to `~/.config/openclaw-growth/AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8`, run `chmod 600` on it, and share only `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.
- If OpenClaw runs under systemd, prefer an `EnvironmentFile=` pointing at the `chmod 600` env file and restart the service; never put secrets in command-line args.

## Mandatory Baseline

Before autopilot runs, these are non-negotiable:

- `analyticscli` CLI available
- target repo checkout readable via `project.repoRoot`
- a writable `openclaw.config.json`
- `sources.analytics` enabled

GitHub connection is strongly recommended for serious analysis, even when GitHub delivery is disabled.
Treat readable GitHub repo access as very important because analytics signals become much more actionable when OpenClaw can map funnels, events, crashes, revenue signals, and feedback back to actual code areas.
Without repo context, findings stay generic and file/module hypotheses are lower confidence.

When the user says they want to connect GitHub or the codebase, do not ask them to manually send a repo path first.
Reference and use the dedicated ClawHub GitHub skill when available: `steipete/github` (`https://clawhub.ai/steipete/github`).
It is a `gh` CLI helper skill for issues, PRs, runs, and advanced `gh api` queries, so it should own GitHub command patterns while this skill owns product/growth analysis.
Install or verify it before deeper GitHub setup when OpenClaw can manage skills:

```bash
openclaw skills install steipete/github
# or
npx clawhub@latest install github
```

Start the GitHub CLI setup flow yourself:

1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to detect the local repo root.
2. Run `git remote get-url origin` and infer `owner/repo` when possible.
3. Run `gh auth status`.
4. If `gh` is not authenticated, start `gh auth login` and tell the user to complete the browser/device flow.
5. After auth succeeds, use local repo context for read-only code analysis immediately.
6. Ask for issue or pull-request write permissions only if GitHub delivery is enabled.

If GitHub auth is missing, do not stop at "GitHub is blocked" or "no GitHub auth configured".
Either start the login flow directly with `gh auth login`, or, if the runtime cannot run interactive auth, print the exact next steps:

```text
GitHub is not connected yet.
1. Run: gh auth login
2. Choose GitHub.com.
3. Prefer HTTPS unless the repo already uses SSH.
4. For code analysis only, read-only repo access is enough.
5. If issue creation is desired, add Issues read/write.
6. If draft PR creation is desired, add Pull requests read/write and Contents read/write.
7. Verify with: gh auth status
```

Use the least privilege GitHub access that matches the requested workflow:

- code analysis only: readable repo/code access is enough; prefer `gh auth status` / `gh auth login` when an existing GitHub CLI login can be reused
- if the user must create a token, prefer a fine-grained read-only token with `Contents: Read` and `Metadata: Read`, and ask for access to all repositories only when the user wants cross-repo code analysis
- issue creation: add issue write permission only when GitHub issue delivery is enabled
- pull-request creation: add pull-request and contents write permission only when draft PR delivery is enabled

## Delivery Modes

The CLI can write proposals to one or more targets:

- `deliveries.openclawChat.enabled = true`: write `.openclaw/chat/latest.md` and `.openclaw/chat/latest.json` for OpenClaw to pick up in chat
- `deliveries.github.mode = "issue"` with `deliveries.github.autoCreate = true`: create implementation-ready GitHub issues
- `deliveries.github.mode = "pull_request"` with `deliveries.github.autoCreate = true`: create draft PRs that add `.openclaw/proposals/...md` proposal files to the repo

## Connector Model

Built-in channels:

- `analytics`
- `revenuecat`
- `sentry`
- `feedback`
  default command path: `analyticscli feedback summary --format json`
  default cursor behavior: first run `--last 30d`, later runs `--since <lastCollectedAt>` unless the command already sets explicit time flags

Additional connectors:

- configure `sources.extra[]`
- each extra connector can use `mode=file` or `mode=command`
- preferred output is shared `signals[]`
- crash-style tools may use `issues[]`
- feedback-style tools may use `items[]`

For iOS/macOS products, explicitly ask whether the user wants to connect the `asc` CLI and the related App Store Connect agent skill. ASC means App Store Connect, not analytics.
Never abbreviate this as just "analytics" in status messages, because it is easy to confuse with AnalyticsCLI.
Say "ASC / App Store Connect" when referring to `asc`, and "AnalyticsCLI baseline" when referring to the AnalyticsCLI project.
An AnalyticsCLI auth check, selected AnalyticsCLI project, or successful PM run does not prove that ASC is connected.
Only say ASC is connected after `asc` auth is configured, the App Store Connect app id is known, and a read-only ASC command/export has succeeded.
Frame ASC as an App Store Connect connector, not as a synonym for analytics. AnalyticsCLI remains the product analytics baseline; App Store Connect reports can optionally add discovery, downloads, usage, purchase, subscription, ratings, reviews, release, build, and TestFlight context.
Do not request ASC permissions for release management, TestFlight management, pricing changes, user management, or other write/admin workflows when the user only selected read-only App Store Connect reporting.
Reference the ASC skill pack as the canonical companion skills for `asc`: `rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills` (`https://github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills`).
Use it for `asc` command syntax, auth, pagination, ID resolution, and App Store Connect workflows; for read-only App Store Connect reporting prefer the least invasive skills such as `asc-cli-usage` and `asc-id-resolver`, not release/submission/signing skills.
Install or refresh it when the user selects ASC:

```bash
npx skills add rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills
```

ASC setup guidance:

- Ask: "Soll ASC CLI fuer App Store Connect verbunden werden?"
- Recommend the least-privilege App Store Connect API access that can read the required App Store Connect reports: prefer a Sales/Sales and Reports style role for generated reports; Finance can work but is broader; Admin should only be used temporarily when a new report type must be requested for the first time.
- Prefer an individual API key for a user limited to the target app when possible; team API keys can cover all apps and are broader.
- Tell the user where to create the key and include direct URLs: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api for team keys, https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/users for access management, or https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/account for individual keys.
- Store only env vars/secrets: `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, and `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY` or `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`; never commit the `.p8` private key.
- Do not ask for `ASC_APP_ID` upfront. After auth succeeds, auto-detect/list apps; if ambiguous, ask for the app name first. Store `ASC_APP_ID` only after it has been resolved.
- After the key is present and the target app is inferred or selected, run one read-only `asc` smoke test before marking ASC connected.
- Prefer `asc auth login` when the local `asc` CLI supports keychain storage; otherwise use runtime env injection.

RevenueCat setup guidance:

- Ask: "Soll RevenueCat fuer Monetization-/Subscription-Daten verbunden werden?"
- For SDK instrumentation, use the public app-specific SDK key only in the app.
- For server-side growth summaries, request a RevenueCat secret API key stored server-side only. Prefer a v2 secret key with read-only permissions for charts/metrics and required project configuration resources such as apps, products, offerings, packages, and entitlements; add customer/subscriber read only if the selected summary needs it.
- Tell the user where to create it and include direct URLs: https://app.revenuecat.com/projects/<project_id>/api-keys, replacing `<project_id>` with the RevenueCat project id; if unknown, start at https://app.revenuecat.com/. Include https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/projects/authentication for key docs.
- Store it as `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` in OpenClaw secret storage or runtime env; never put it in client code, config JSON, issues, or PR bodies.

## Feedback Rules

- Always include a stable `locationId` for feedback collection points
- Always include a human-readable `originName` for where the feedback originated in the product
- Prefer AnalyticsCLI feedback retrieval via `analyticscli feedback summary --format json` instead of maintaining a second feedback definition
- The SDK should track lightweight feedback submission events without sending raw feedback text into analytics events

## Feedback Source Memory

- The CLI should persist per-source cursor state, especially for the built-in `feedback` source
- Default behavior must avoid accidental historical re-fetches
- If `sources.feedback.cursorMode = "auto_since_last_fetch"` and the command has no explicit `--since`, `--until`, or `--last`, the CLI should auto-append a bounded window
- Re-fetching older history should always be a conscious action by changing the command or resetting cursor state

## Startup Protocol

When the user says `start`, `run`, or `kick off`:

1. Prefer the CLI entrypoint:
   - `openclaw setup --config openclaw.config.json`
2. Then run:
   - `openclaw start --config openclaw.config.json`
3. In this monorepo, use the workspace dev entrypoint when `openclaw` is not installed globally:
   - `pnpm --filter @analyticscli/openclaw-cli dev -- start`
4. Run portable checks first when setup is incomplete:
   - `command -v analyticscli`
   - `analyticscli projects list`
   - detect `project.githubRepo` from git remote when possible
   - verify readable GitHub repo access when available so analytics findings can be mapped to code
   - verify GitHub issue/PR write scopes only if GitHub delivery is enabled
5. If preflight fails, return only a concrete blocker checklist
6. If preflight passes, continue with `openclaw run --config openclaw.config.json`

## Proposal Strategy

The CLI config should expose `strategy.proposalMode`:

- `mandatory`: only strongest, clearly evidenced fixes and must-have requests
- `balanced`: default mix of necessary fixes and moderate product ideas
- `creative`: still evidence-led, but more willing to suggest bolder experiments or feature ideas

## Output Rules

- max 3-5 proposals per pass
- each proposal must include measurable impact and file/module hypotheses
- each proposal must say what should change
- low-confidence findings must be marked explicitly
- when GitHub delivery is disabled, proposals should still be fully usable via the OpenClaw chat outbox

## Required Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  strongly recommended with readable repo/code access for code-aware analysis
  required with write scopes only when GitHub issue or pull-request delivery is enabled
- `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY` or `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
  optional; ask before setup
  App Store Connect read-only reporting data only
  prefer Sales/Sales and Reports style access; Admin only temporarily for first-time report type requests
- `ANALYTICSCLI_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  recommended for AnalyticsCLI command/API mode when no local CLI login exists
  do not ask for `ANALYTICSCLI_READONLY_TOKEN`; the readonly token is passed to `analyticscli login --readonly-token <token>` or stored as `ANALYTICSCLI_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY`
  optional; ask before setup
  use a server-side secret API key for RevenueCat command/API mode
  prefer v2 read permissions for charts/metrics and required project configuration resources
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
  recommended for Sentry command/API mode
- optional connector-specific `secretEnv` per `sources.extra[]`
